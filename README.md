# Python-Linked-List
My first Linked List in Python. Check it out!

# Overview

Now further on my journey into trying to become a self-taught software engineer, I tackled linked lists. 
They're my first data structure outside of arrays that I've tackled, and I had no experience with this prior, and it was 
hard to wrap my head around it the first time around. I've coded this exact scheme maybe five times, and the fifth time 
I coded it was today when I did it and uploaded the repository.

## What This Repository Includes

This includes a linked list class, it includes a node class, and if you 
follow the formula that I put in, that is if you put a list into main and then you
do the for loop in there and you hit display, you can add nodes, you can delete nodes,
you can put any list in there, and it will create you a linked list.

## Next Steps

For my next project, I would like to implement other data structures or code a dynamic array 
from scratch in C++. I also have some projects coming up that I'm excited to post that I'm 
working on, and hopefully they come to fruition sooner rather than later.

## Future Additions

In the future, I'd like to write a mechanism for this repository to be able to
reverse any linked list, to display it and then reverse it, but that is going to come later.

## Closing

I hope you guys enjoy this, and we're in week five of my self-taught coding journey.
